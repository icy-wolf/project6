  <p class="lead">Where there is one wolf... there are always more. They work together to hunt and protect each other. Typically a wolf does not stay a lone wolf for long as they find a mate and start their own pack. These amazing creatures have been often been hunted and misunderstood. Though they are still few in number, wolves still are magnificent creatures.</p>
